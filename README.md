# IO SelfCare - Import Adesioni

We are migrating our subscription base (`Adesioni`) toward our new `SelfCare` portal. This is a tool meant to process in a batch execution our actual codebase.

Due to the nature of the project, it's been easier for us to use Italian words for domain concepts

* `Adesione` / `Adesioni` - An entity representing the subscription of an Organization to IO; it includes the Organization's id and all its contracts
* `Ente` / `Enti` - Organizations
* `Allegato` / `Allegati` - Attachments
